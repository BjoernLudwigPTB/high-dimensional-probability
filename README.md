# high-dimensional probability

A mind map of the definitions, theorems, lemmas, propositions and references of the course "High-dimensional probability with applications in data science" of the Technische Universit√§t zu Berlin in winter semester 2019-2020.

Maybe at a later point we add some more material.

Let [us](https://github.com/BjoernLudwigPTB/high-dimensional_probability/graphs/contributors) know, if you have questions.
